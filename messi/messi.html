<p>Early life</p>
</div>
<div class="messiearlylife"><p><div>Lionel Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. From a young age, he showed exceptional talent in football, playing for his local club, Newell's Old Boys. However, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency that his family couldn’t afford to treat. His football potential caught the attention of FC Barcelona, who offered to pay for his medical treatment and bring him to Spain. Messi joined Barcelona’s youth academy, La Masia, at 13, where he quickly rose through the ranks due to his incredible skill, vision, and goal-scoring ability. Then he started playing for the FC Barcelona U14 team.
