    <h1>2.Cristano Ronaldo</h1>
    <p>Early life</p>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, a small island off the coast of Portugal. He grew up in a humble household with his parents, three siblings, and a strong passion for football. From a young age, Ronaldo showed exceptional talent and dedication, often playing for hours on the streets. At just 12 years old, he moved to mainland Portugal to join Sporting CP’s youth academy in Lisbon, a major step that took him far from his family but brought him closer to his dreams. By the age of 16, his speed, skill, and work ethic had already caught the attention of top scouts, setting the stage for his rise to football career.</p>
    <p>Football Career So Far</p>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest footballers in history, known for breaking records and setting new standards. He holds the record for the most international goals ever scored, with 123 goals in 201 appearances for Portugal, and was the first player to reach 100 competitive international goals. Ronaldo is also the only player to score 10 or more goals in the UEFA Champions League for three different clubs Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. At Manchester United, he set a club record by scoring 31 goals in a single Premier League season. Later, during his time at Real Madrid, he became the club’s all-time top scorer with an astonishing 451 goals in just 438 games. Right now he is playing for Al-Nassr.
