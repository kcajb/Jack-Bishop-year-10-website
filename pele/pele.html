    <h1>3.Pele</h1>
    <p>Early life</p>
    <p>Pelé, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on October 23, 1940, in Três Corações, Brazil, grew up in a poor family. His father, Dondinho, was a footballer, and Pelé developed a passion for the sport early on. As a child, he often played barefoot with a sock-stuffed ball. Despite financial hardship, his talent was evident, and by age 15, he joined Santos FC's youth team. His skills quickly drew national attention, and at just 16, he made his professional debut.</p>
    <p>Football Career So Far</p>
    <p>From the age of 18, Pelé had already become a global football sensation. He won his first World Cup with Brazil in 1958 at just 17 and continued to shine throughout his career. Playing primarily for Santos FC and later for the New York Cosmos, Pelé dazzled fans with his skill, creativity, and goal-scoring ability. Over his career, he scored 1,283 goals in 1,367 official and unofficial matches, making him one of the highest goal scorers in football history. He won three FIFA World Cups (1958, 1962, and 1970), the only player ever to do so, and became a global ambassador for the sport.</p>
